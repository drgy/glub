# glub
Compilation configurator for OpenGL applications. More information on contributing can be found in [wiki](https://github.com/drgy/glub/wiki).

## Quick start

To run glub locally [Deno](https://deno.land/) is required, after it is installed the server can be started by running:

`deno run --config ./tsconfig.json --allow-net --allow-read server.ts`
